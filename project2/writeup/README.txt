I tried to run my code in the shuttle using Javac, but it doesn't work. Therefore, I included .class files and modified the makefile so you can run my code using make run-server or make run-client.

Or use:
java server 127.1 9012, for the server side

And:
Java client 127.1 9012, for the client side
